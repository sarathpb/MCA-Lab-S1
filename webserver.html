    <p>A web browser is a software application used by users to access and view content on the internet, such as web pages and other web-based resources.
 It acts as a client in a client-server system, sending requests to web servers for specific web content.
 When a user enters a URL, the browser initiates an HTTP request to retrieve the corresponding web page.
 The browser then processes and displays the received content, which can include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In contrast, a web server is a computer system or software that stores, processes, and delivers web content to clients upon request.
 It functions as a server in the client-server model, accepting HTTP or HTTPS requests from web browsers, locating the requested resource, and sending back the appropriate response.
 This resource can be a pre-existing file (static content) or dynamically generated content created at the time of the request.
 Web servers can be implemented as software (like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS) running on dedicated hardware, or as embedded systems within devices like routers.


    </p>
    <p>
        The primary interaction between a web browser and a web server occurs through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with an HTTP response containing the requested data.
 This communication is fundamental to how the web operates, enabling users to access websites and interact with online services.
 While the browser is installed on the user's local device
 , the web server can be located anywhere on the internet, potentially on a remote machine or even on the user's own computer

      <p>The most commonly used web servers include Apache, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), Nginx, and LiteSpeed.
 Apache, developed by the Apache Software Foundation, is an open-source software that supports a wide range of operating systems like Linux, Windows, Unix, and Mac OS X, and is known for its stability and modular structure.
 It has historically held a significant market share, with estimates suggesting it powers around 60% of web servers.
 Nginx is another popular open-source web server renowned for its high performance, stability, and efficient handling of multiple concurrent connections using an event-driven architecture, which results in low resource usage.
 Market share data from October 2021 shows Nginx leading with 34.95%, surpassing Apache's 24.63%.
 IIS is a web server software package designed by Microsoft for Windows Server, tightly integrated with the Windows operating system, and is widely used in environments utilizing Windows platforms.
 LiteSpeed is a commercial, high-performance web server that acts as a drop-in replacement for Apache, compatible with common Apache features like mod_rewrite and .htaccess, and is known for improving performance and lowering operating costs.</p>
